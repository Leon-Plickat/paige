# Paige

Paige is a light colourscheme for vim with ultra minimal syntax highlighting,
high accessibility and pleasant colours.

Inspired by the
[modus-operandi](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-03-10-emacs-modus-themes-elpa/)
theme for emacs, Paige aims to be beautiful, yet accessible. For that purpose,
it follows a few simple design choices.

* Black text on white background, for the highest possible readability
* Syntax highlighting with bold text instead of any colours, to reduce the
  visual noise on the screen to a minimum
* Avoiding crass contrasts for UI elements
* Highlighting text by changing the background instead of the foreground colour,
  with very few exceptions
* And many more...

## Contributing

While I generally welcome contributions to my projects, please understand that
something like a colourscheme is extremely subjective. If you have any ideas,
send me an email, so we can discuss them.

However, patches I will most likely always accept are those which add support
for a previously unsupported vim plugin or feature, using only the already
predefined colours.
